I was motivated to create this tech blog so I could better create procedurally generated sites without relying on hardcoded html.

I hope that one day I can expand this code and similar into my own personal messageboard.

Currently this allows people to post messages on this board and leave comments.

While building this I learned a lot about seeding databases and what not to do.
